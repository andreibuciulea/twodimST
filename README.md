Description

  This repository contains MATLAB code used to reproduce the experiments presented in the paper:
  
  Learning Product Graphs from Two-Dimensional Stationary Signals
  Andrei Buciulea, Bishwadeep Das, Elvin Isufi, Antonio G. Marques

  The code provides implementations for:
  
    1. Generating two-dimensional stationary signals on product graphs.
    
    2. Estimating product graphs using different convex optimization models.
    
    3. Running 2D sweeps over signal parameters and evaluating metrics such as Frobenius error, F-score, runtime, and commutativity.
    
    4. Plotting aggregated results (mean and median) for performance comparison across models.
